A project template for Arduino/AVR hacking with the following contents:

- A simple C program (toggles the LED on Arduino Pin 13).
- Makefile, including an UPLOAD command. It is based on the one described
  at http://www.nongnu.org/avr-libc/user-manual/group__demo__project.html.

To run the example on your arduino follow these steps:

1. You need to have installed
    - avr-gcc,
    - avr-libc,
    - avrdude.
2. Connect your Arduino via the USB-cable
3. Modify the file "Makefile":
    - Set "MCU_TARGET" to the particualar microcontroller on your
      Arduino board.
    - Set "SERIAL_PORT" to the filename of your USB/Serial adapter. If you
      are unsure about the name, look for it in the Arduino IDE under
      "Tools" -> "Serial Port".
    - Set "CLK_FREQ" to the clock speed of your Arduino. At 16 MHz it is
      most probably correctly set, already.
4. Run "make upload". The LED on Pin 13 should start to blink.
