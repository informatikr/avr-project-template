A project template for Arduino/AVR hacking with the following contents:

- A simple C program (toggles the LED on Arduino Pin 13).
- Makefile, including an UPLOAD command

It assumes you have installed
- avr-gcc,
- avr-libc,
- avrdude.

To run the example on your arduino:
1. Connect your Arduino via the USB-cable
2. Modify the file "Makefile":
    - Set "MCU_TARGET" to the particualar microcontroller on your
      Arduino board.
	- Set "SERIAL_PORT" to the filename of your USB/Serial adapter. If you
	  are unsure about the name, look for it in the Arduino IDE under
	  "Tools" -> "Serial Port".
	- Set "CLK_FREQ" to the clock speed of your Arduino. At 16 MHz it is
	  most probably correctly set, already.
3. Run "make upload". The LED on Pin 13 should start to blink.
